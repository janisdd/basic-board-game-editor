# i18n

i18n is every simple implemented in the dir `i18n` there is a file `i18nRoot.ts` which contains the `keys` for every string that should be translated

as `keys` we use the english version of the text to translate

if you want to add a new string just add a prop to the `LangObj` interface

and use it inside a component with

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import {connect} from "react-redux";
import {bindActionCreators, Dispatch} from "redux";
import {returntypeof} from 'react-redux-typescript';
import {RootState} from "../src/state";
import {Button, Icon} from 'semantic-ui-react'
import {getI18n} from "path/to/i18n/i18nRoot";

export interface MyProps {
}

const mapStateToProps = (rootState: RootState /*, props: MyProps*/) => {
  return {
    langId: rootState.i18nState.langId
  }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch<any>) => bindActionCreators({
}, dispatch)

const stateProps = returntypeof(mapStateToProps);
const dispatchProps = returntypeof(mapDispatchToProps);
type Props = typeof stateProps & typeof dispatchProps;



class Test extends React.Component<Props, any> {
  render(): JSX.Element {
    return (
      <div>
        <Button>
          {getI18n(this.props.langId, "KEY")}
        </Button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Test)
```

note that `getI18n` can be auto imported by webstorm

because we use typescript the `KEY` needs to be defined inside the `LangObj` else the compiler will complain

then you need to add the actual translation for the `key` (the phrase)

in the dir `i18n` add a new file for the language (if not does not exist yet)

and simply create a constant like

```ts
export const lang_en: LangObj = {
  "key": "some text"
}
```

the compiler will complain if you missed some `key`

after that we need to make sure the app knows the language

switch back to `i18n/i18nRoot.ts`

and add the language to the `KnownLangs` enum and the `const i18n: LangMap = {...}` constant

## html inside translations

sometimes we want e.g. line breaks inside our translation or make something **bold**

react allows us to use html inside strings but we need to set the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property of the component

for this use the function `getRawI18n` e.g.

```ts
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={getRawI18n(this.props.langId, "KEY")}>
</div>
```

if you use html markup `< or </` with the `getI18n` function an runtime error is displayed


## discussion

we *could* use real keys instead of the the english version of the text to translate but...

if you work on the component and you see just the key it's sometimes hard to tell what the string behind is




currently we don't support translation with injections/interpolate e.g. numbers like

`you clicked 3 times` we would need 2 `keys` one for `you clicked` and one for `times`
